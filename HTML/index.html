    <h1 style="color: slateblue;">About me</h1>
    <p>Hi all. I am livin at Sakarya, a city in Turkey. I started to be a programmer approximately
        20 years ago. My first language was <b style="color: red;">c</b> followed by <b style="color: red;">pascal c++ c#</b>. Now I am interested with the <b style="color: red;">python</b> and <b style="color: red;">Java languages</b> as well as <b style="color: red;"> js, web frameworks</b> and much more.
        the technology does not stop growing.</p>
    <h1 style="color: slateblue;">Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I like to read books and to watch films. Of course, depending on the weather broadcast, I also like to play some sports outside. The kind of sport is unimportant for me, the main point is to have fun and to be healthy.</p>
